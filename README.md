# Trabalho sistemas embarcados 
This is a work developed for the Embedded System class for the Mechatronic Engineering course at Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos - Universidade de São Paulo.
The class is ministered by the Professors Glauco Augusto de Paula Caurin and Daniel Varela Magalhães and the monitor Henrique Garcia.

### Project:
The main objective was to develop an embedded system using BeagleBone Black or Toradex platforms.
Our group chose to develop a controlled rotational platform for recycled glass bottle's finishing using a blowtorch using the Beaglebone Black (https://beagleboard.org/black). 
Recycled glass bottles are cut into a cup using an electric resistance. The unfinished cup is attached to the rotational platform where its edges finishing is done with the help of a blowtorch.
The platform can rotate with three different programs, varying speed and total time, as required for each type of glass bottle, according to diameter and glass thickness.

#### Components:
- BeagleBone Black
- H-Bridge L298N
- 3x White LEDs
- 2x Push Buttons
- 6V DC motor with gear reduction

#### Coding:
The coding was done on Python for Linux (https://github.com/python) and (Adafruit-BeagleBone-IO-Python https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python)
